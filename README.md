I'm trying to track my spending without subscribing to those annoying Rocket Money ads. I'm not a fan of the idea that to have interesting insights into my spending I have to give a third party access to my data and either pay (which is expensive) or not (in which case I'm really the product).

I figure that I have all the data - I'm just missing the comprehensive tracking, and the visualizing. I know how to code, so why not build it myself? I don't need anything fancy. 

Roadmap:
- [x] Shortcut to log apple wallet transactions as they happen (pythonista logs in a csv)
- [ ] Some data manipulation to bring all my different historical spending data extracts into the same format. 
- [ ] Visualizing that combined spending using python
- [ ] Learning scriptable
- [ ] Plot spending data in scriptable to make it a widget that I can easily reference.
- [ ] Add predictive capabilities.
